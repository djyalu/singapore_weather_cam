    2. Scribe persona crafts clear, culturally appropriate content
    3. Joint review for clarity and completeness
    4. Collaborative localization and cultural adaptation

analyzer + refactorer:

  process:
    1. Analyzer persona identifies root causes of quality issues
    2. Refactorer persona designs improvement strategy
    3. Joint implementation of systematic refactoring
    4. Collaborative validation of improvements

devops + security:
  scenario: "Infrastructure automation with security compliance"
  process:
    1. DevOps persona designs deployment and infrastructure automation
    2. Security persona evaluates compliance and threat surface
    3. Joint implementation of secure automation pipelines

```

### Conflict Resolution Mechanisms

```yaml
Conflict Resolution Process:

Priority Matrix Resolution:
  1. Identify conflicting recommendations
  2. Apply persona-specific priority hierarchies
  3. Evaluate context-specific overrides
  4. Document resolution rationale

Context Override Scenarios:
  - Emergency situations (security > performance)
  - Compliance requirements (security > convenience)
  - User experience critical paths (frontend > backend)
  - Technical debt paydown (refactorer > architect)

Escalation Paths:
  System-wide conflicts: architect persona mediation
  Educational conflicts: mentor persona facilitation
  Quality disputes: qa persona arbitration
  Security concerns: security persona final authority
```

## Usage Patterns & Best Practices

### Manual Persona Selection

```bash
# Explicit persona activation for specific tasks
/analyze --persona-security --focus security
/implement --persona-frontend --magic
/improve --persona-performance --benchmark
/document --persona-scribe=en --style detailed
```

### Persona Combination Strategies

```yaml
Complex System Development:
  Planning Phase:
    - Primary: --persona-architect
    - Consulting: --persona-security, --persona-performance
    
  Implementation Phase:
    - Frontend: --persona-frontend --magic
    - Backend: --persona-backend --c7
    - Testing: --persona-qa --playwright
    
  Quality Assurance:
    - Code Review: --persona-refactorer
    - Security Review: --persona-security
    - Performance Review: --persona-performance
    
  Documentation:
    - Technical Docs: --persona-scribe=en
    - User Guides: --persona-mentor + --persona-scribe
```

### Best Practices

#### 1. Persona Selection
```yaml
Do:
  - Let auto-activation work for routine tasks
  - Use explicit flags for complex cross-domain work
  - Consider user experience impact in persona choice
  - Match persona expertise to task requirements

Don't:
  - Force inappropriate personas for tasks
  - Ignore auto-activation suggestions without reason
  - Use multiple competing personas simultaneously
  - Override safety-critical persona recommendations
```

#### 2. Cross-Domain Collaboration
```yaml
Do:
  - Plan persona collaboration for complex tasks
  - Document cross-persona decisions and rationale
  - Respect domain expertise boundaries
  - Use validation personas for quality assurance

Don't:
  - Skip security review for public-facing features
  - Ignore performance implications in architecture
  - Bypass QA processes for rapid development
  - Neglect documentation in persona workflows
```

#### 3. Quality Assurance
```yaml
Do:
  - Use appropriate quality gates for each persona
  - Validate persona recommendations against requirements
  - Monitor persona effectiveness and adjust as needed
  - Document persona-specific quality standards

Don't:
  - Lower quality standards for speed
  - Skip validation steps in persona workflows
  - Ignore persona-specific best practices
  - Compromise on domain-specific requirements
```
