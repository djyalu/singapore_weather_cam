  "raw_analysis": " Here is a detailed analysis based on the given real-time weather data of Singapore, creating an engaging weather story that captures the interest of the audience. \n\n1. **Current Temperature Situation Analysis** \n\nCurrent temperatures in Singapore are averaging 32.9°C, with a high of 34.8°C and a low of 31.6°C. The temperature range is important to consider, as it provides a clearer picture of the fluctuation and variation across different regions. Comparing seasonal characteristics and the general Singapore climate, the temperature is typically higher in the afternoon and lowers at night, following a diurnal pattern. \n\n2. **Humidity and Heat Index Analysis** \n\nHumidity is often a discomfort factor, with current averages of 51% (high of 61%). Understanding the Impact of humidity on perceived temperature is crucial, especially when it exceeds 40%, as it becomes uncomfortable and poses health risks. Heat Index (HI) is a measure of the potential for heat stress, considering both temperature and humidity. With the current humidity levels and the perceived temperature, it is essential to ensure adequate breaks and avoid prolonged exposure to the sun. \n\n3. **Rainfall Pattern and Prediction** \n\nRainfall is currently at 0.0mm, with no rainfall recorded in the last hour. While there are no significant rainfall patterns in the short term, the NEA official forecast mentions thundery showers as the general weather pattern. Understanding the geography and topology of Singapore, urban streets and surfaces tend to retain and amplify thunderclouds, leading to a higher likelihood of lightning and thunder than in surrounding rural areas. These tendencies are essential to consider regarding lightning safety and urban planning. \n\n4. **Overall Weather Pattern Interpretation** \n\nA comparison of NEA's official forecast and real-time data is done to determine their consistency and predictability. This also involves evaluating the typicality and peculiarity of the current weather situation, considering historical data and seasonal trends to determine if the current weather is following expected patterns or deviating from them. \n\n5. **Activity Recommendations** \n\nRecommendations are provided for optimal activities throughout the day, divided into morning, noon, evening, and night. Specific activities, such as workouts, rehearsals, or work activities, are suggested according to the perceived temperature and humidity, aiming to enhance comfort and productivity. \n\n6. **Health and Safety Guidelines** \n\nHealth risks associated with the current weather are outlined, focusing on vulnerable groups, including the elderly, children, and outdoor workers. Skin and respiratory diseases are referenced according to the UV index and air quality index (AQI). Sunscreen, hats, and hydration practices are recommended to minimize exposure to harmful UV radiation. \n\n7. **Weather Highlights** \n\nThree key points are highlighted as the most significant weather features of the day, such as temperature variation, humidity, or rainfall. These points are explained and referenced in poetic and captivating ways to draw the reader in. \n\n8. **Tomorrow's Forecast and Preparation** \n\nThough the forecast is generally accurate, it is important to stay vigilant and prepare for potential changes. An overview of tomorrow's weather is presented, utilizing current data to make predictions. \n\n**Guidelines:** \n\n- Provide 6-8 paragraphs of robust, engaging, and captivating content. \n- Maintain a balanced scientific accuracy and creative expression. \n- Write in a captivating and fluid style that immerses the reader in the weather. \n- Include cultural and geographical characteristics of Singapore that naturally weave into the analysis. \n- Avoid limitations in quantity and expression, aiming to attract and satisfy the reader with attractive and useful content.
