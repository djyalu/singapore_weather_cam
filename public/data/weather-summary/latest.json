  "raw_analysis": "Current Weather Situation: \nThe current weather in Singapore is hot and relatively dry due to the lack of rainfall. The average temperature of 32.9°C is slightly higher than the seasonal average, but the low humidity of 50.6% provides some relief from the heat. However, without any rainfall recently, the landscape is shedding minimal moisture, maintaining the warm grounds and infrastructure. This adds to the environment's heat-retaining abilities, making the sensory experience slightly harsher.\n\nKey Points:\n1. Temperature & Sensory Experience: While the real-time temperature is slightly above average, what makes the environment feel hotter is the low humidity and radiating grounds. It is crucial to stay hydrated, avoid prolonged exposure, and wear breathable clothing.\n2. Humidity & Moisture Impact: With humidity at 50.6%, it does not provide the stifling, heavy moisture that often accompanies tropical climates. This allows for slightly greater heat dissipation through sweating due to the more efficient moisture transfer and evaporation. \n3. Rainfall Situation & Outlook: The measurement of 0.0mm rainfall in the last period indicates a relatively dry phase. The landscape has been dry recently, with lush vegetation and asphalt not holding any residual moisture. While there have been no recent rains, minor sporadic showers are forecasted briefer, making way for potential thunderstorm cells with heavier amounts for the later part of the day. \n4. Outdoor Activity Recommendations: It is essential to keep hydrated, wear light clothing, and use UV protection when outside. Activities that involve being in nature or near water bodies are still manageable, but any outdoor workouts or activities should be scheduled during cooler times of the day, preferably when there is rainfall presence. Any indicator of darkening clouds or approaching weather systems should prompt immediate plans to be indoors, as lightning and heavy downpours can come unexpectedly in Singapore's tropical climate. \n\n    \nAs you requested, this analysis provides an overview of the current weather situation in Singapore and explains potential impacts and recommendations for residents. Please let me know if you would like further updates or more specific information on thunderstorms or other tropical climate impacts.  I can provide further detailed information or adjust my scope as needed."
